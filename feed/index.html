										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you are (hopefully) aware, our 2024 strategic plan includes seven goals, one of which is tied to <strong>Pride Initiative F.3.1</strong>. In that initiative (and its accompanying WIG), we aim to improve the variance against our staffing standard as a way to help us remain profitable and thereby contribute toward ensuring the organization&#8217;s future. A committee overseeing this important goal has met with every Mh department, working with managers and directors to determine how to meet the initiative.</p>
<p>One department in particular has stood out thus far, in accomplishing this vital objective. <strong>MedSurg/ICU</strong>, under the direction of Angie Hathaway and Stephanie Hart, has made huge strides in trimming staffing hours to meet the standard. For the first time in a year, the department’s staffing levels were actually within their department&#8217;s standard.</p>
<p>Last year, an external consulting firm was utilized to provide Mh leadership with benchmarking statistics, including direct comparisons of staffing levels between ourselves and other, similar organizations. Based on the results of this study, our Admin team updated our staffing standards and issued the challenge for each department to adhere to them. Monthly reporting shows staffing levels and helps us know whether we’re hitting the target.</p>
<p>“Unlike last year, we’ve begun sharing the results in our UBC meetings, every month,” said Angie Hathaway, Director of MedSurg/ICU. “ I think that showing the actual data, rather than just talking about things, has been very motivational.”</p>
<p>“Our QTLs are really the ones who are driving the success,” added Stephanie Hart, Manager of MedSurg/ICU. “They’re focusing on three things. First, the nurse-to-patient ratio during low-census times, which means QTLs have to be willing to send nurses home. Second, putting nurses on call, rather than having them come in, helps keep our numbers in line. And, third, QTLs are willing to take patients themselves, often toward the end of a shift, to prevent having to call another nurse in.”</p>
<p>“Our entire staff has been willing to be flexible, and sometimes make personal sacrifices,” said Angie. “It has made all the difference. We’re so proud of our team, and their willingness to communicate, and work together, to help our department reach this important milestone.”</p>
<p>For other Mh departments which may be struggling to meet the staffing standards, Angie and Stephanie and their QTLs are available to provide suggestions and encouragement. Working together, we can all make a difference as we, as an organization, meet this pride initiative and do our part, department by department, to help keep Madisonhealth stable and strong for the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Story by Jeremiah Kalb</p>
<p>Hospitalist Jack Clark has found that long days of treating patients have conditioned him to conquer multiple mountain passes in Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming (LoToJa) on his endurance road bike in just half a day.  </p>
<p>“I see my work here as mental training for the endurance sports stuff I do,” Clark says. “It’s rare that I feel burned out and have to get out of the white coat. And I rarely have to get off my bike.”</p>
<p>He has participated at LoToJa, the longest one-day USA Cycling sanctioned bicycle race in the country, four times as a solo rider and multiple times on relay teams since 2008. LoToJa’s website states it is one of the nation’s premier amateur cycling races and continues to be a grueling test of one’s physical and mental stamina. The doctor just rides to cross the finish line. </p>
<p>Clark, a hospitalist at Madison Memorial Hospital, says he discovered his love for endurance sports after seeing his older brother return home from a three-day road bike tour in Yellowstone National Park. He decided he wanted a piece of the action and completed a similar trip a few years later as a junior in high school. Clark prepared himself for the scenic trip by periodically biking 60 miles round trip from Cody, Wyoming, to the nearby town of Powell to buy bike parts.</p>
<p>His endurance sports lifestyle consists of biking, marathons, and triathlons. Besides helping him stay in shape, endurance sports offer him some alone time in a world that can be chaotic and demanding. “Open time on the road gives you the time to think, to find out who you are, and connect with yourself,” says Clark. He does not carry a cell phone during these times to help safeguard his space. “It’s an opportunity to get deep in my thoughts and let my mind wander in different directions.” </p>
<p>Clark has found the sweet spot regarding self-care, the practice of taking an active role in protecting one’s well-being and happiness, particularly when stressed. With most of the world being in a constant state of anxiety and panic, perhaps regular self-care is the most necessary prescription to fill in one’s life.</p>
<p>He completed his first marathon in 2007 in Richmond, Virginia. This particular race was deeply emotional for our physician with a calm demeanor. “I had a younger sister who died in a car accident when she was 19,” a teary-eyed Clark says. “She had a bucket list of things she wanted to accomplish in her notebook. Running a marathon was on that list.”</p>
<p>While Clark was training, he told the race organizers he wanted “Jill’s Race” printed on his race bib. He later jetted off to Virginia with Jill’s dream in his heart. </p>
<p>Up to mile 15, Clark was doing good and ten minutes ahead of schedule. “My lungs were feeling great. My energy level was great. But going up this tiny incline and within three steps, I went from feeling great to wondering if I was going to finish the race.” His left knee started acting up to the point where he needed to stop running and resorted to walking with 11 miles still to go. </p>
<p>“I&#8217;m doing this race in memory of my sister,” Clark stresses. “Quitting was not an option, so I had no choice but to grind it out for the rest of the race.” For Clark, it was mentally challenging because of the pain and watching his superb time evaporate into thin air while others passed him by. </p>
<p>The last mile he will never forget when he felt his sister’s presence. “Jill was helping. She was encouraging. People talk about a spiritual aspect of running, which seems to connect you with the other side and forces you can’t see.”</p>
<p>Subsequently, to stay in the sport after his injury, Clark first adopted the Chi Running method. It is a technique that teaches the runner to use the core muscles, upper body, and gravity to do the hard work rather than placing all the strain on the leg muscles. “Adding in the Galloway Method [alternating run-walk intervals], I’ve done 28 miles and went to work the next day feeling fine,” Clark says. </p>
<p>He finds triathlons particularly challenging due to the preparation required to figure out how to transition from one sport to the next [think getting out of a wet suit, mounting a bike, etc.] on race day and balance the training of three different sports. “When you cross-train for three different sports, you’re training different muscles. It seems protective in terms of not having as many injuries.”</p>
<p>Endurance sports have taken Clark and sometimes his family to faraway places. “I did a 70.3 on the Big Island of Hawaii. We took my parents over to that one for a week and made it a family adventure.”  A 70.3 is a half Ironman-distance triathlon, consisting of a 1900m swim, 90km bike ride, and half marathon to finish.</p>
<p>Clark’s most recent excursion abroad was an eight-day bike tour of southern France with a group of six, amounting to 425 miles and 28,000 feet of climbing. </p>
<p>On this trip, he learned something unexpected and impactful from the slowest member of the group. Clark took turns riding with different people in the group in order to learn something from each person, and at first, Rohndia encouraged him to ride with someone else. “Rolling her eyes realizing I was not going anywhere, she quipped, you’ll learn from me that you can go two miles an hour and not tip over.” </p>
<p>These words stuck with Clark because, in terms of riding slower, his physical senses became amplified like never before on the road. “I could feel the temperature differences. When I went in and out of trees, I heard birds singing. I saw more things in terms of color and took more pictures. Something is soothing about going forward on a bicycle at this speed,” Clark says. </p>
<p>For Clark, it is not about the three drawers full of racing t-shirts or the medals; it is about savoring the journey and connecting with his community of fellow endurance sports enthusiasts. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-family: Abel; font-weight: normal;">Story and Photo by Jeremiah Kalb</span></p>
<p>When patients visit Madison’s Behavioral Health Unit, they work with several professionals to help them return to good mental health.</p>
<p>The most well-known professionals involved in this care include a psychiatrist, social workers, and nurses.</p>
<p>A recreation therapist is a lesser-known professional who is equally vital to a patient’s success.</p>
<p>Emily Johnson, a full-time certified recreation therapist, describes recreation therapy as “helping people discover their zest for living because it’s those activities that you do every day that make you who you are.”</p>
<p>Simply put, Johnson helps patients help themselves.</p>
<p>“But more with a purpose of mindfulness and intent,” she adds.</p>
<p>The roots of recreation therapy first appeared during World War II when the Red Cross provided hospitalized soldiers with recreation therapy programs.</p>
<p>Leisure, recreation, and play make up the foundation of recreation therapy.</p>
<p>Without recreation therapy, a patient may find it challenging to achieve the highest quality of life.  </p>
<p>For example, a simple card game checks the boxes for two of the five domains of recreation therapy: mental/cognitive functioning and social function.</p>
<p>“Cognitive thinking processes can really suffer when you’re going through a depression or anxiety,” Johnson points out.</p>
<p>The other three domains include physical functioning, psychological/emotional functioning, and spiritual function.</p>
<p>Johnson came to Madison after an internship at Eagle Mount in Billings, Montana, where she ran programs that ranged from equine therapy to whitewater rafting. Her clients might have suffered a traumatic brain injury or lost a limb.</p>
<p>Despite being nervous about venturing into mental health, Johnson applied and landed the job.</p>
<p>“I like to think I’m a forward thinker,” she says.</p>
<p>The hospital saw the value of Johnson&#8217;s therapeutic discipline quickly as the unit prepared for its grand opening in 2021.</p>
<p>“She taught us how important recreation therapy is in the stabilization of mental health crises,” says Marci Crook, Social Work manager.</p>
<p>Johnson’s first assignment on BHU was a tall order. Stand up a recreation therapy program from scratch.</p>
<p>She came well-prepared for this kind of challenge.  </p>
<p>Johnson obtained considerable exposure to recreation therapy in various community settings, including starting up and running an adaptive sports camp for youth.</p>
<p>“That was my first experience developing a program that reached a lot of people’s needs because it was open for the community,” Johnson says.</p>
<p>Nine months later, Johnson is in her groove, delivering  impactful patient experiences.</p>
<p>“I just love when they come to me after, and they’re like, I felt that was just for me,” she says.</p>
<p>BHU offers four recreation groups a day. Each group can have anywhere from one to 12 people.</p>
<p>Johnson finds psychological/emotional functioning the most challenging domain to work within.</p>
<p>“Just because emotions are hard,” she says. “They’re hard to regulate. It’s difficult to allow yourself to experience the full range.”</p>
<p>For this, Johnson loves facilitating a group called “Music and Emotions.”</p>
<p>“They draw how the music makes them feel,” she says. “Music tells a story on its own and without having to relive certain moments, patients can experience emotions in a safe and controlled setting.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Johnson and her colleagues are doing their part to stamp out the stigma of mental illness and help others find meaning, independence, and purpose. </p>

<p>The late co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, once said that it’s not a faith in technology. It’s faith in people.</p>
<p>Pharmacy Director Dorsie Sullenger, one of Madison’s longest continuously-serving employees, credits his team for the technology innovations he’s helped bring to the hospital’s pharmacy over the years.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a brilliant staff,” Sullenger says. “I’d put them up against anybody in the state. They’ve all embraced technology.”</p>
<p>During his time, Sullenger has seen the typewriter give way to computers. Computers and phones shrank down to devices his team carries in their pockets, and the internet means work is always with them, for better or worse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-32081" src="https://i0.wp.com/madisonhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/Dorsie-pharmasist-director-52-yrs-300x187.jpg?resize=300%2C187&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="187" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Raised near or below the poverty line in Rigby, Idaho, there was only one car in Sullenger’s household, so he walked everywhere as a teen.</p>
<p>“I paid for most of my school clothes,” he says. His first job at Western Auto earned him forty-five cents an hour.</p>
<p>Sullenger was the first member of his immediate family to graduate from college.</p>
<p>“When I was a kid growing up, that’s all I got hammered into me was you will go to college, and you will get a professional degree,” he says.</p>
<p>Sullenger switched his major from accounting to pharmacology after three years of dealing with a professor who made him and his classmates look like fools in front of the class.</p>
<p>“I had always liked chemistry, and I was really good at math,” Sullenger says. As a kid, he carried a picture in his mind of Ken Regan filling prescriptions at Idaho Drug.</p>
<p>“That always intrigued me,” Sullenger says.</p>
<p>He applied and was accepted into the Idaho State University pharmacy program almost immediately.</p>
<p>Today, Sullenger drives a Tesla, a good example of how much he loves hard work and technology, especially plug-in electric cars.</p>
<p>After spending just a few minutes with the man, it is apparent that Sullenger stands in awe of the advancements of humanity and a person’s potential to make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Sullenger first set foot on the Madison campus in September of 1979 as a staff pharmacist working 20 hours a week that first year.</p>
<p>A year later, Sullenger was hired on full-time, then became the director of the pharmacy in 1982.</p>
<p>“I have seen a lot of changes in the last 42 years at Madison,” he says. “We went from using an electric typewriter to print prescription &amp; IV labels to a sophisticated software system that auto prints almost all of these labels.”</p>
<p>Because of the hospital’s growth, his team has expanded from five employees to eleven over the years, including the addition of a board-certified oncology pharmacist.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of Sullenger’s most significant achievements has been keeping Madison’s Pharmacy at the forefront of emerging technology for over 40 years.</p>
<p>Despite Madison beginning as a small, rural hospital, Sullenger’s demonstration of his tech prowess and business acumen has been very valuable to a growing county-owned single-entity organization.</p>
<p>His long resume includes the 340B Drug Pricing program that saves the hospital over five million dollars a year, computerized pharmacy software, Omnicell’s automated medication dispensing system, smart pump technology, and recently IVX, an integrated solution that safely and consistently guides technicians step-by-step through the IV compounding process.</p>
<p>What has all of Sullenger’s hard work translated to?</p>
<p>“The hospital pharmacists’ role has switched from a dispensing mode to a clinical mode,” he says.</p>
<p>And this helps keep the hospital’s patients safe and back on the road to recovery and wellness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After nearly three years of intensive efforts, culminating in an application process with a post-application survey, Madison Memorial has been awarded one of the most prestigious, hard-to-earn, coveted credentials in the healthcare industry: the <strong><em>Pathway to Excellence</em> </strong>designation.</p>
<p>On Monday, April 18, during a noteworthy phone call between Madison Memorial staff members and Dr. Nora Warshawsky, Pathway Commissioner for the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC), the Madison team was officially notified of our attainment of this long-sought goal. We are now<strong> the first (and only)</strong> Pathway-to-Excellence certified organization in the state of Idaho.</p>
<p>The Pathway designation is a global credential, highlighting an organization’s commitment to creating a healthy work environment where nurses are empowered and valued. Madison Memorial’s nurses constitute an integral part of our team, wielding a powerful voice both in our policies and practices. Pathway nurses, including ours, are<strong> fully engaged</strong>, which yields higher job engagement, reduced turnover rates, improved safety, and better patient outcomes.</p>
<p>According to Chief Nursing Officer Dr. Kevin McEwan, “This designation would not have come to pass without the individual contributions offered every day at Madison Memorial. We thank our nurses for making our organization the great place it is, and for cultivating efforts to continually <strong>improve our patients’ experience and quality of care</strong>.”</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Dr. Rachel Gonzales posited, “What does this mean for Madison Memorial’s health system?” In answer, she said, “Our nurses embody the Pathway standards in shared decision-making, leadership, safety, quality, wellbeing, and professional development. I personally see this as <strong>a testament to our team</strong>, as to how fortunate we are to have them, and for their achieving this designation despite such critical times of healing in healthcare.”</p>
<p>“Speaking on behalf of our physicians,” added Dr. Clay Prince, Chief Medical Officer, “we appreciate our nurses and how they wear themselves out on behalf of our patients. We thank them for their professionalism and for exhibiting compassion, always.”</p>
<p>Representatives from Madison Memorial will be in Philadelphia in October to receive our official recognition plaque at the upcoming <strong>ANCC National Conference</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Abel; font-weight: normal;">Story by Jeremiah Kalb</span></p>
<p>On a chilly evening in March, Anna Struhs loaded a bag of slip leashes and dog collars into her Honda Pilot in preparation for a two-and-a-half-hour drive to Utah.</p>
<p>The following day, two furry animals named Misty and Queenie waited at the I-15 Exit 344 in Ogden for the next three legs of their “freedom ride,” and Struhs was their driver.</p>
<p>In the “rescue world” where Struhs has played a part since 2019, a “freedom ride” is a magical carpet ride out of an animal shelter and eventually into the loving arms of a new owner.</p>
<p>“They are there because some human failed them miserably, by surrendering or abandoning or dumping them,” Struhs says.</p>
<p>Approximately 3.1 million dogs enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. About 390,000 of those dogs are euthanized each year.</p>
<p>For this transport, Struhs received a text asking her if there was any way she could also transport some rabbits out of Brigham City.</p>
<p>“I can do that,” she replied.</p>
<p>Any day Struhs has off from operating the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner is a day she is transporting animals within Idaho or across neighboring state lines.</p>
<p>Over the years, Struhs has transported cats, rabbits, potbelly pigs, guinea pigs, and one rat, but mostly dogs.</p>
<p>“It means giving them a chance at a life of love, something they didn’t have before,” she says.</p>
<p>Pet transport is the transfer of adoptable pets from over-populated areas to regions of the U.S. where demand for adoptable pets is high.</p>
<p>In the case of Misty, she came in from Cedar City, Utah, as a terrified dog.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what happened in her life, but she loved me and loved being around people,” Struhs says.</p>
<p>Misty was saved just in the nick of time. Her euthanization was planned just 24 hours before her freedom ride.</p>
<p>“Misty had $450 worth of pledges to help her get out of the shelter because she was not getting the response she needed,” she explains.</p>
<p>Queenie, a heeler, was an owner surrender from the Salt Lake City Humane Society.</p>
<p>Heelers are known for their high energy levels and exceptional ranges of resourcefulness and intelligence.</p>
<p>Queenie was no different.</p>
<p>“As soon as she saw those bunnies, she went wild,” Struhs says.</p>
<p>Struhs sometimes houses her new furry friends in between transport legs. Misty and Queenie stayed the night.</p>
<p>Her brother picked them up the next morning to transport them to Second Chance Pet Rescue in Coeur d’Alene.</p>
<p>This first overnight out of the shelter was their first opportunity to decompress.</p>
<p>Struhs pointed out that shelters are very stressful for dogs because they hear barking all the time.</p>
<p>“They don’t get that time to just relax and be a dog and be loved on, so it’s really important,” she says.</p>
<p>Upon arriving home, she remembered what she was told earlier that day. Queenie is an escape artist.</p>
<p>During introductions to Struhs own dogs, she kept Queenie on a tight leash in the backyard. Eventually, Queenie got to run under Struhs watchful eye.</p>
<p>“I kept the leash on her just in case I had to grab her quickly,” she says.</p>
<p>Queenie and Misty made themselves right at home.</p>
<p>“Misty laid in my Lazy boy recliner and loved herself,” she says. Queenie quickly followed suit.</p>
<p>Fortunately for these two dogs, they got their day with the help of Struhs and her fellow rescuers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-family: Abel; font-weight: normal;">Story and Photo by Jeremiah Kalb</span></p>
<p>Prolific poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson once proclaimed, “In my walks, every man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I can learn from him.”</p>
<p>Ambulatory Services Executive Director Kyle Loveland has found great success in striving to live this principle throughout his career.</p>
<p>“I have benefited greatly by realizing that every person I work with is better in at least one way, often many than I am,” Loveland says. “I always learn something from each person I work with.”</p>
<p>He has used this success principle several times to get where he was as a hospital intern to presently providing Ambulatory Services leadership to about 100 employees and support for about 40 providers.</p>
<p>Raised in Colorado and Wyoming, Loveland did not grow up thinking he would find a career in healthcare.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t until my last few semesters of my undergrad that I realized there was even a business side of healthcare and that it might be a good fit for my business brain and my love of people,” he says.</p>
<p>After a hospital internship in 2011 and a series of position advancements as a front-line employee and leader, Loveland remembers when he was invited to apply for the Director of Nutritional Services position.</p>
<p>I laughed because I had zero experience in that position,” Loveland says.</p>
<p>While he held images of sharp knives, searing meats, bubbling pots, and the hustle of plating orders, the hospital did not want him to be a cook like he initially thought.</p>
<p>“I was told we need you to be able to fix the business side of things and improve there,” Loveland says.</p>
<p>He knew he could do that, applied, and got the job.</p>
<p>As a practitioner of the Shingo Model, based on the principles of Shigeo Shingo, who taught thousands of engineers at Toyota, Loveland started to address operational issues, but with a human touch.</p>
<p>“When you focus on and take care of the people, everything else seems to fall in place,” he says.</p>
<p>When one thinks of improving the bottom line, drill-downs on spreadsheets often come to mind first.</p>
<p>The first two principles of the Shingo Model are “Respect Every Individual” and “Lead with Humility.”</p>
<p>In the beginning, team members whispered, “Kyle does not know anything.”</p>
<p>Determined, Loveland would smile back and tell them they were absolutely right. “That’s why I’m going to shadow you,” he told them.</p>
<p>The first month Loveland started by following each employee through their workday.</p>
<p>He had a plan to learn and serve.</p>
<p>“I had three main questions,” he says. “I asked them, what do you love about your job? What do you not love about your job? And what would you change if you could about any process that you feel is broken?”</p>
<p>The response he received from his team was positive.</p>
<p>“First of all, I got comments like, I can’t believe you are here,” Loveland says. “You’re actually asking me what I think.”</p>
<p>With a clear starting point, he rolled up his sleeves and went to work, sometimes behind the grill and cash register.</p>
<p>When Loveland finished his work in the Paragon, they were on track to have higher revenue than in years past; then, the pandemic hit, forcing them to close their doors.</p>
<p>“I left it in great hands with Timmy and the rest of the team,” he says. They did a tremendous job throughout the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Today, Loveland is making great strides in his current role by continuing to build and foster relationships and learn who his people are and how he can best support them.</p>
<p>“Kyle is a pragmatic, process oriented, people person,” CNO Kevin McEwan says. “These are the attributes and characteristic that have led to our continued success.”</p>
<p>So we see that learning and growing go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Each year in the United States, there are approximately 53 million outpatient surgical procedures and 46 million inpatient surgical procedures.</p>
<p>All of these procedures introduce a significant risk to the patient – infection.</p>
<p>Bacteria like Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas left on surgical instruments can infect the surgical site and lead to patients becoming gravely ill and requiring further medical attention following surgery.</p>
<p>If surgical instruments are not sterile, this may also mean spreading serious illnesses or diseases such as HIV/AIDs, Hepatitis, and more.</p>
<p>Central Sterile Processing Supervisor Margaret Wood’s job is to lead a mighty team of three technicians that help eliminate all pathogenic microorganisms.</p>
<p>Sterilization ensures that infectious pathogens do not transfer to the patient.</p>
<p>“Because of our work, patients can safely undergo surgery,” Wood explains.</p>
<p>She sees Central Sterile as a critical part of the hospital’s backbone.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that patient safety begins in the Central Sterile Processing department, and the rest of the hospital would not be able to function without them.</p>
<p>Central Sterile Processing is the hospital area where cleaning, decontamination, inspection, assembly, packaging, storage, and distribution of instruments, equipment, and supplies takes place.</p>
<p>Wood, a 22-year veteran of sterile processing, runs the day-to-day operations for the department.</p>
<p>Her team handles upwards of 900 instrument sets each month.</p>
<p>Despite high productivity pressures, a total joint replacement alone can have anywhere between six and eight trays, and Wood’s team did 286 of these last year; they take pride in their work.</p>
<p>The mission is singular yet complex: to safeguard patients from infections.</p>
<p>“Behind every instrument, there’s a patient, and so we’re patient advocates,” she says.</p>
<p>Attention to detail is an absolute must every minute of every day for Wood and her team.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure every instrument in that set, whether it be ten or whether it be 100, is what’s supposed to be in that tray and is working properly,” Wood says.</p>
<p>Strict adherence to the “process” is imperative even when a surgeon drops an instrument and needs it back ASAP.</p>
<p>“You’re going to be waiting 25-30 minutes to get it back,” Wood says. “We try to have backups for things that could be dropped, but sometimes we just don’t.”</p>
<p>While a surgeon might expect the instrument back immediately, there’s no room for cutting corners.</p>
<p>“If that was your mother, your sister, your husband or wife, or child, would you want us to do it halfway, or would you want us to do it the proper way?” Wood asks.</p>
<p>The proper way includes hand washing and machine cleaning at 180 degrees. Instruments are then put through Steam, Parasitic Acid, or Hydrogen Peroxide sterilization.</p>
<p>Several types of test indicators are used to monitor whether the necessary conditions were met to kill a specified number of microorganisms for a given sterilization process.</p>
<p>“Having all these checks makes it so we as sterile processing people and the nurses and techs in the room know they can safely use these instruments,” she says.</p>
<p>There is much to be said about the thought and effort that goes into Wood’s carefully wrapped blue packages.</p>
